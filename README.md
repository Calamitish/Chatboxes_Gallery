# Chatboxes

Hi!  
I'm Calamitish, in my spare time I make Chatboxes for Twitch, Discord and Picarto.  

Welcome to my gallery, here you can find most of my completed works :D  
Do mind that animations and transparency might not work in these previews.

# If you've previously received a chatbox

Lucky you!  
You can find back-ups of all image resources on [Chatboxes](https://github.com/Calamitish/Chatboxes).  
The .css code and font files are all in private repositories.  
please contact me if you want access to the repository.  

A handy guide to install them can be found [here](https://github.com/Calamitish/Chatboxes/blob/main/How%20to%20install.png)!  

If at any point you find a bug or issue, feel free to contact me and I'll fix them ASAP.  
I'll also generally update all chatboxes if I happen to find any breaking bugs myself.  

# If you haven't

I'm currently **non-commissionable**.  
Every chatbox here is a passion project of mine and one-of-a-kind.  
Please do not alter, re-use or re-upload any of the assets unless I give you direct permission.
