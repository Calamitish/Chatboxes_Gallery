# Chatboxes

Hi!  
I'm Calamitish, in my spare time I make Chatboxes for Twitch, Discord and Picarto.

Welcome to my gallery, here you can find most of my completed works :D  
Do mind that animations and transparency will not work in these previews.

# If you've previously received a chatbox

Lucky you!

If at any point you find a bug or issue, feel free to contact me and I'll fix them ASAP.  
I'll also generally update all chatboxes if I happen to find any breaking bugs myself.

# If you haven't

I'm permanently **non-commissionable**.  
Every chatbox here is a passion project of mine and one-of-a-kind.  
Please do not alter, re-use or re-upload any of the assets unless I give you direct permission.
