# The end of Chatgelion

Hi, I'm Calamitish, ex-vtuber and fulltime software engineer.  
If you're reading this, we've probably crossed paths at some point, and you might have a custom Twitch chat made by me.  
I'm no longer making any custom chats or other Twitch and streaming related widgets.  
What you see here are remnants of something that used to be.

That said, I'll make sure that everything still here keeps working as is.  
My contact is below, if there is ever an issue, feel free to contact me.

Please do not alter, re-use or re-upload any of the assets here unless I give you direct permission.
